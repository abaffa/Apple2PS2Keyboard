# AppleII+ PS/2 Keyboard

This is a AppleiII+ Spectrum keyboard emulator based on an AVR microcontroller, used in Baffa-6502 Apple ][ homebrew clone project.
It works by converting the PS/2 keystrokes and updating its outputs with the corresponding apple ii keys pressed.

Thanks to [Danjovic](https://github.com/Danjovic) for the original TeV2 project which was the starting point for this project.
